# Changelog

## 3.0.0

### Fix
* Revert automatic conversion, add filter instead (4e91c50a5938ab641a90cb84fabd56ff992c757c)

### Breaking
* Replace tfk-api-unoconv service with unoconv listener (f12f0a221b64fb22665ac4609e4f52e34ff767f2)
  * `UNOCONV_LOCAL` and `UNOCONV_URL` are no longer supported configuration options. Please remove
	them from your configuration file.
  * By default an unoconv listener gets launched within the container. To use a different listener
	you can specify `UNOCONV_SERVER` and `UNOCONV_PORT`.

* After gathering some practical experience with the new automatic "Listing"-conversion for
  multiline we noticed that this feature is a little bit too "clever" and breaks many advanced
  use-cases. (4e91c50a5938ab641a90cb84fabd56ff992c757c)

## 4.0.0

### Breaking
* Remove support for external unoconv listeners
  * `UNOCONV_SERVER` and `UNOCONV_PORT` are no longer supported configuration options. Please remove
	them from your configuration file.
  * By default an unoconv process gets launched within the container.
